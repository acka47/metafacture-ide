h1. Overview

The Metafacture IDE provides an integrated environment for using and contributing to the "Culturegraph Metafacture":https://github.com/culturegraph/metafacture-documentation tools.

It consists of Eclipse installer setup files for easy creation of a working environment, an Xtext-based editor, and a launcher for the Metafacture Flux language. Flux is a domain-specific language (DSL) used to drive metadata transformation workflows based on Metafacture, a stream based data processing framework with an XML-based metadata transformation language.
